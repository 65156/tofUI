# Jekyll configuration for GitHub Pages
# This enables Jekyll processing which rebuilds the site whenever files change

# Basic settings
title: "tofUI+ Dashboard"
description: "Better OpenTofu & Terraform Plans"

# Build settings
markdown: kramdown

# Exclude files from processing (but they'll still be copied to _site)
exclude:
  - README.md
  - .gitignore

# Keep these directories in the output without processing them
# This prevents Jekyll from trying to process JSON files as templates
keep_files:
  - reports

# Include these patterns (JSON files should be copied, not processed)
include:
  - reports/*.json

# Disable automatic processing of data files
# This prevents Jekyll from loading all JSON files into memory
safe: true

# GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild when any file changes
# JSON files in reports/ will trigger rebuilds but won't be processed
